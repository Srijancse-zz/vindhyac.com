I quickly realised, I was intrigued by other parts of the business than engineering. So I made the switch and became what everyone that cannot be an amazing engineer becomes - An <strong>okayish</strong> product manager. </p>\n<p>I have worked on <strong>Next Billion Users</strong>, built for India, worked in consumer high growth teams, in SaaS products that focussed on India &#x26; products that dabbled outside India too. I have dabbled in ASO, growth, user testing, preparing go-to-market strategies, elaborate content strategies and customer relations. </p>\n<p>I love plotting graphs and knowing what the users were trying to achieve, but I also love talking to the real users. So while I can be rigid about data, I am also <strong>BIG</strong> on communication. I think this is exactly why I am extremely cross-functional, collaborative &#x26; voice of the customer! I am constantly\nlooking to learn, so I always try &#x26; read a little &#x26; write sporadically. I also love analysing other apps and won an <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/product-manager-of-the-year-hacker-noon-awards-2019-or-noonies-cj6z3859\">internet award</a>\nto brag about it. </p>\n<p>If you read this long, maybe you can will enjoy reading more of my gibberish on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vindytalks\">Twitter</a> or connect with me on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vindhya-c/\">Linkedin</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about"}}}
