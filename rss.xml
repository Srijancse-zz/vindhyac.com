You should probably skip this if you were looking for steps, that blog will be up next. But if you were just curious &amp;#x26; if you think my way could help you, read away :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So like every other science student in India, I studied engineering. I didn’t really want to do that, I wanted to major in English &amp;#x26; history, but ah life :)! So I ended up doing computer science. I didn’t go to a well-known college at all, so if you’re asking me how do you get into big companies when you’re from tier - A college, my answer is I don’t know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I would like to think I was decent at engineering, I graduated with a campus placement(this story is so cliché!). I went on to be an iOS engineer at ITC. I worked in a department that was associated with Innovation. They were supposed to make pitches to clients with prototypes of how they could build innovative solutions for them. So, briefly someone would write a proposal &amp;#x26; I would build it. I hated this, for many reasons(which is not worthy to be written, but if you meet me, ask me?) but I mainly hated it because I just didnt fit in here, I wrote more on the WHY, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vindhyac.com/posts/product-company-vs-service-company/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. While, I got these business proposals, sometimes they were not written very well, they didn’t give more information and had no mocks to build apps on. So I used to do them myself, fill the gaps in the document before I coded things. It was clear to me that while I was an average programmer, I could be good at this! That is when I applied to any role I could find that took me to the business side of things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what product management was at this time. Zero idea. I got into a role at Directi (a company I didnt know was a big deal back then). The role was - Project Management. Since I was at a service - based company, the project managers did most of the business things. The documents, managing team, deciding what to build etc. So in my naive sense, I thought I had the job I wanted. Turns out, it was not. A month into JIRA boards and pinging people if they had finished their tasks, I had realised this was not for me. I was very good at it, though I am told. But, I really liked Directi. I loved the energy, amazing talented folks &amp;#x26; great knowledge all around. I took another month to learn all things product. What really helped me was my friendship with the nicest person I could find at work - Sanya! She is a senior designer at Uber now, but back then she was a product manager with Directi. I moved my seating ( I think the best thing I did) to where she sits aka product team sat. I would peep into what they did, asked the silliest questions &amp;#x26; asked everyone to teach me something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would go to everyone in the product &amp;#x26; design team and say - “ Can you teach me how you did that? That is very cool.” In hindsight, I think it was very silly of me but I really did not know better. So, one day Manas ( the twitter’s favourite PM) sat across me and I said the same thing - “Teach me what you do.” If you dont know him, Manas was not an easy person to get help from, but he was also very to the point. He would always gauge if you were putting in the effort, if you had passion and would probably only then even have a conversation with you. So in a very Manas way &amp;#x26; I quote him verbatim, he said : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, if you really want to be a PM, read this - Cracking the PM interview first, you will learn what all is asked in every interview, once you get that &amp;#x26; understand the complexity then we can talk” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I had an in finally! I can do this I thought. &lt;em&gt;frantically googles the book&lt;/em&gt; . I said, “Alright, I will come back to you when I am done, then.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lots of people within this floor ask me every day how to be a PM, it seems so easy &amp;#x26; fun. It is that, but it is also a lot of work. No one wants to put in the work. We will probably discuss again in a month, my guess is you would not have finished the book by then too. That’s how everyone is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-he would tell me the next day. I probably could have said something then but I didnt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cracking the PM Interview&lt;/strong&gt; - is a 400 page odd book, but it taught me so much. I read the whole thing in a few hours perhaps, but I think I did not respond to him right away because I wanted to have something useful to talk next. Of course, I read the book the day he had recommended it, but I went back and read some more articles on the topics in the book. The third day from our original conversation, during a tea break I referenced an article and I asked him a doubt to which he said - “Maybe we can discuss this after you read the book?” “Oh I read it the day you told me to, which is how I landed up here, so tell me about this?” I think out of all the things this PM journey has given me, one of my favourite things will be watching him look at me dumbfounded and with pride :). I will skip the rest of the brag conversation and tell you what we did next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now he knew I was serious. I also knew I was serious, I knew this is what I saw myself doing. Every other day he set an automated meeting with me to discuss various things. Well, not so much discussion, more critiquing my tasks. He would give me -  redesign, strategy, product thinking question &amp;#x26; review my document in this meeting. We did 4 of these meetings. Soon after this, seeing us discuss more designers would get curious and ask us what we were up to. So, Manas held a PM-for dummies 1-hour core session. I remember this entire hour from memory even today. It was really basic but most important stuff. I sat in every product meeting I could, wrote some mock specs &amp;#x26; discussed products a lot more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i had the prep work done, now I needed a way to get into doing some product stuff. I didnt know where to start. So, I wrote a four-page document on content strategy for growth &amp;#x26; sent it to the CEO &amp;#x26; product head. I thought I did a great job(lol) but I barely got a response. So I decided there was no reason to wait around that I should probably interview. That is how, Loco happened. Loco was a - live streaming quiz platform. The tech seemed amazing, I had read a lot on live streaming, the team seemed very small ( this was before the acquisition). They didnt have a team or an opening, but I wrote to Abhishek on Facebook! Because at this stage I didnt
Even know what twitter could help me achieve! I wrote a really long message, but here is what it concentrated on.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asked me to send in my resume, in two days I interviewed and the third day I had an offer, which now I know happened after a discussion with Manas as well. Loco was where I learned so much I was reading hands-on. I meant some very talented people here, but most important people I learned from were - Sushil ( one of the cofounders at Loco) he would deep dive into all topics he cared about &amp;#x26; was very focussed on his learning. I also learned quite a bit from Obvious - a design agency we had worked with to redesign Loco. I remember meeting Rahul here &amp;#x26; realizing how little I knew about everything design. Vikalp, at Obvious, was the designer I got a chance to work with &amp;#x26; my first interaction with him, like all my previous phases - I said - “ I know nothing about design, what should I learn?” I had obviously asked this question to every designer I met, but he was the first one to send me so much reading material! But, needless to say everyone I worked with taught me something, and I am not just simply saying that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok so, if you made it this far, here is my closing advice.
Read the book
Try writing a product spec and pitch internally at where you work
Reach out to people who you think will be able to help, but do some homework.Dont just ask - “How do I become a PM” instead ask - “ Hey, I read this &amp;#x26; as a PM I would do this. What do you think? Am I doing this right?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the founders at Loco asked Manas about me, I remember he told them I had a great bias for action. That is exactly what you need - Take action &amp;#x26; pursue it. Lots of - how to guides on getting into PM, but I will write a longer one and link it here as well, if you are interested, I will post about it - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vindytalks&quot;&gt;@vindytalks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building a clubhouse for India - A playbook]]></title><description><![CDATA[Clubhouse works because of its exclusivity, a very well known virality hack.

You can read more &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;https://divinations.substack.com/p/inside-the-clubhouse&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is fascinating, some have called it the app that will revolutionise social, some believe it will die down as more people enter. I find myself somewhere in between, maybe in another post I will tell you why. But for now, If I were to build this app for an Indian context, what would I do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clubhouse works because of its exclusivity, a very well known virality hack. This also means like &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/future-of-tv/hq-trivia-trying-turn-viral-sensation-media-business/&quot;&gt;HQ trivia&lt;/a&gt; once it all dies down, it could not go as well as one would hope. So even though the easiest way to get traction &amp;#x26; money is to just copy that tactic &amp;#x26; give exclusivity to big folks here in India. I am proposing that you don’t. Well unless you want to raise money &amp;#x26; figure it out along the way. It is just that I have been part of this virality craze, it dies &amp;#x26; you have no idea what to do next. You will throw money into ads &amp;#x26; pay people to be on your app, but you go nowhere with this. &lt;strong&gt;So I would say pick a user persona, go deep into it &amp;#x26; figure out if people really want to talk to one another.&lt;/strong&gt;
I say this because the people that would otherwise be on the app (tech folks/VCs) are only there because it’s hip &amp;#x26; new, in a few months you wont be. You will just be dead. Yeah, I am being extremely cynical, because just picking an app &amp;#x26; hoping it works elsewhere is not the way to build anything sustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say, that you should not focus on tech folks, you can if that is what you want, but go deep into this vertical. Ok you picked your people, now what? &lt;strong&gt;Set topics.&lt;/strong&gt; Virtual meets happen because there is already an agenda in place. I know Clubhouse is defined as a party place, but you dont randomly show-up to a party, you go because the people there are those you like or want to be like. Emulate this. Discuss controversial things like - “Microservices are the worst way to build” or helpful topics like - “Server spends - Optimised. War stories”. India needs content, we discuss usually on top of things, so give them a direction to talk about &amp;#x26; make it catchy! &lt;strong&gt;A Buzzfeed article on audio.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clubhouse here doesnt have to be off-record only, it can be &lt;strong&gt;a medium to create content.&lt;/strong&gt; This strategy could work, considering Instagram also lets you edit photos and didn’t push you to post there in its early days. Let the author have the ability to allow listeners to snip their content, share and download it on other social mediums, make sure to add an auto audio - “powered by YOURAPPNAME” at the end of all the clips for brand recall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/&quot;&gt;Youtube’s&lt;/a&gt; usage stats or any other medium where you can be a listener or creator you will see a pattern emerge. The listeners always outgrow the creators, it almost the law of social apps. Earlier in your app, this is excatly what you must avoid. You’re at a party talking to people, they need some feedback, why else will people talk to you, when they could well, write a blog about it? &lt;strong&gt;Make sure everyone is a speaker at some point.&lt;/strong&gt; You can be very talkative or to the point speaker, but you must engage. The whole premise is built on people wanting to talk to each other. Of course eventually your app will follow the norm, but not right now. You want people to be there &amp;#x26; discuss with their peers/friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the momentum going.&lt;/strong&gt; You are essentially building a community, you want people to share things even after the conversation is over. Build a messaging service within the app (the obvious ones) or leverage your Oauth. I assumed you would authorize people through their other social profiles, &lt;strong&gt;to minimize friction&lt;/strong&gt; ( So I guess that is another thing to do), when you do this, build a network through it. Get people to converse outside the room they were in. Say - “Hey @vindytalks would you like to connect with @personIdontfollow and take this further”. It is okay to take me outside your app, you are not there to get me to give you all my hours, you are there to make how many ever hours I give you meaningful. If I find value in these conversations I am coming back exactly here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants a podcast. People like having 1-1 conversations in podcast style and build on that. It is very hot in the user persona I chose as an example here. So what if you could do just that? If people had conversations &amp;#x26; could publish the entire thing on your app, like a social media/audio? site. Give the ability for people to do exactly things they want to with no friction? A podcast with no mic, no invite &amp;#x26; no cold emails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the non-hype people.&lt;/strong&gt; Find people that are known, but haven’t really spoken a lot on podcasts interviews, videos etc. When you have given 300 webinars/talks you are really saying the same things. You want something fresher. You want to say “Hey I heard this from @vindytalks and this was so cool I had to share” (Yeah I self brag because who else will ;)). You want people to feel like they are discovering talent/ people who never were found before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many more ideas that could stem within each one of these sectors, pick something from here or otherwise, but please dont build a copy-cat version of what exists. It will not stick and will get you nowhere after that 1-week hype or when this lockdown ends. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to run Product sprints ?]]></title><description><![CDATA[You all have heard of the design sprint if you have not, read more here.  It was introduced inside Google & has been widely adapted, however working with this book has enabled me to think of a  product sprint inspired by this, Let me explain how it would work.]]></description><link>https://www.vindhyac.com/posts/run-product-sprints/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.vindhyac.com/posts/run-product-sprints/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2020 23:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You all have heard of the design sprint if you have not, read more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesprintbook.com/how&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It was introduced inside Google &amp;#x26; has been widely adapted, however working with this book has enabled me to think of a product sprint inspired by this, let me explain how it would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The people:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representation from each department will be great + 2 from Customer Success. The teams can either be Design, Frontend, Backend, Strategy, Product(ofcourse!) or follow the squad way (if that is what your company follows) and have all the team leads in there. I don’t suggest the latter if you have too many teams in your organization, since more people means more time &amp;#x26; more confusion. However you know what works best for your team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The process:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally the design sprint is a 5 day process with 5 stages, Concentrating on various things everyday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, product sprint will only have 3 steps &amp;#x26; can be done within 1 day/8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what happens in it -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.  &lt;strong&gt;Understand/Map&lt;/strong&gt;: We will ask the strategists (usually the founders/ CPO/ PO) what their immediate one year vision is (they will talk about what they would like to achieve &amp;#x26; the challenges these goals face for 5 minutes). While they discuss all other members can interview them further. For example - If the founder says - We should grow our sales by 40% this quarter. He/She might get asked - HOW MIGHT WE scale our resources to do this? HOW MIGHT WE(HMW) support the sales team feature wise to achieve this?  These questions shall also be written down. Once done, we will begin putting up all these questions on a wall, you will begin to see that most HMWs follow some pattern &amp;#x26; all the varied questions are actually leading to a bigger question, that will now form the theme of the following discussion. We will now map out an ideal solution that will help achieve this common goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Microscopic target&lt;/strong&gt;: Now that we have a target, we will go around the room (this time strategists dont participate) as to how we can achieve this target with their function’s help or why haven’t we achieved it yet. We do one more round of this where they tell us how we can achieve this target with the help of some other function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Eng lead says we can achieve this by reducing our latency and in the second round he says we can achieve this if product team build better product analytics that help understand what customer needs. You will hopefully see a common enough pattern to what needs our attention right away. Clarity should be achieved at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Clarity extended&lt;/strong&gt;: We will now go back with these insights, look at data + customer insights and derive some patterns around this. We can now decide what needs to be built and how/ what timelines etc. This step involves not everyone but product team alone to figure out the future roadmaps and such. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When should you do this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities for each team are different &amp;#x26; everyone’s thinking might need some alignment. Especially in what you should focus as a company. Even if both of you have a clear understanding, it will help conveying to the team &amp;#x26; getting them onboard easily. This will also help in teams being able to converge &amp;#x26; understand why something needs to be worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know how you strategize product when you are early in the product cycle &amp;#x26; how you navigate through uncertainty. If you do use this method then &amp;#x26; adapt to your own way, tell me what changes worked for you!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[When to hire your first product person?]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have been talking to few startups and this is a common theme that keeps coming up, so I wanted to write this down.]]></description><link>https://www.vindhyac.com/posts/hire-product-person/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.vindhyac.com/posts/hire-product-person/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 23:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have been talking to few startups and this is a common theme that keeps coming up, so I wanted to write this down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dont hire because you can&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolute worst kind of hires for any company is when they don’t require one at all. This often happens for fancy roles like - PM, growth marketer, generalist, business strategist etc. You don’t need people that stay in your company for a title. You have no requirement to have a product team to write a product specification documents, to plan sprints simply because your peers are doing this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dont hire when you need someone to figure this out&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You raised some money or you are promised some money &amp;#x26; now you are looking for someone to build with you, but you don’t know what that something is. It is your product, you have to have a sense of what might be your grand vision. More often than not, PMs get called CEOs, there are those that stand by this tag &amp;#x26; others that don’t. I belong to the latter. It is your grand vision that someone with product sense will help execute. Don’t harp on people to build for you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dont hire for someone to keep tabs for you&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of first time founders or non seasoned technical founders will want to hire someone that understands tech enough to keep tabs on engineers. They want someone to look at tasks, write a non elaborate spec doc &amp;#x26; check in with the management. You don’t need a product person, you want a project manager. Please dont confuse the functions &amp;#x26; hire people that can rock a JIRA/Clubhose board if that is what you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, if I am telling you when not to hire, maybe I should also tell you when you should hire one :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire when you have PM fit&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have scaled enough to know there is traction, there is demand &amp;#x26; definitely a market for what your product can do. You are struggling to know what you should prioritize and build, however you have things in the pipeline that you would like to try &amp;#x26; all your customers are eager for it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire when you are the roadblock&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As founders you are the forefront of what needs to be done &amp;#x26; how it needs to be done. You have expertise, knowledge &amp;#x26; customer conversations to keep your head in the game, but now you ned help. You need another product person to bounce your ideas &amp;#x26; execute on your behalf, you are wearing too many hats &amp;#x26; now you would like someone else to try it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire when your team seems to tell you&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not to your face, but your team will begin showing you signs. The engineering team will face gross miscommunication because there aren’t proper documentations, the customer support team will push for a feature that almost noone uses &amp;#x26; the data is in your face, the testing team will not be synced with what is in production, the business/sales folks were never given status updates &amp;#x26; your marketing team has no idea of what you are building. This is when you hire your product person. But, wait does that mean you hire everyone before you hire your PM? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not always, maybe most of these functions were being handled by you, as founder &amp;#x26; now they are getting too much &amp;#x26; you need someone to come in and handle this for you. Not to take it off your hands, PM is not a fixer of all things but sometimes you need data, structure, A/B tests, user tests, better NPS and better documentation to keep your startup sane &amp;#x26; healthy that is when you get your first zero to one product person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you plan to make your first hire or how did you make it? Did you carefully consider this critical hire? Do you think you would hire a senior person, or a junior eager to learn the ropes. Every hire brings potential questions Id love to know how you navigate through this.

I tried to think of bigger features/ strategic positioning that UC could do, this is a result of that thought experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) &lt;strong&gt;Move-In Package :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target audience&lt;/strong&gt;: New to City, 22–30, doesn’t know the local language, found an independent cheap accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why build this&lt;/strong&gt;: Every year Bangalore itself has a growth rate of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/bangalore-population/&quot;&gt;~4%&lt;/a&gt;, most of which is contributed by people moving into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-1000-people-move-to-bangalore-every-day-1573465&quot;&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. There is an opportunity to capture the young app savvy people on UC, this relationship could go on to prove a long term retention &amp;#x26; low churn rate if job done well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature overview:&lt;/strong&gt; The app has an icon with “Moving In” written under it, clicking it would ask you for services you need; Movers &amp;#x26; Packers, Cleaning, Kitchen set-up, Electrician ( washing machine, Water filters), Wi-Fi(Brand recommendation), Maids, Cooks; You then give your address &amp;#x26; preferred time-slot &amp;#x26; &lt;strong&gt;Boom!&lt;/strong&gt; Just like that, 3 clicks gets you from a house to home versus 10 calls you would have to place &amp;#x26; the information you would have to gather prior to the calling. All simply laid out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Measures:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.of users/MAU users &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If retention of these users is higher or significantly better than other sections of the app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad performance to Installs to Conversions for this feature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it hits your magic number of services a customer avails to be considered loyal, just via this master service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) &lt;strong&gt;Apna Apartment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Audience:&lt;/strong&gt; Smaller apartments (20 homes), don’t have a proper system in place to address issues of the building, local plumbers and others don’t do a satisfactory job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why build this&lt;/strong&gt;: An opportunity to capture an entire apartment is huge, this means that every household &amp;#x26; residents could also be possible users. As, residents move in &amp;#x26; out, this channel will also work as a passive acquisition channel. The apartments counts are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/nearly-1500-apartment-complexes-added-in-two-years/article17462805.ece&quot;&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt; as we speak, although this will involve a bit of Sales team to go and push partnership, on a larger scale it will be worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature overview:&lt;/strong&gt; Will require apartments to signup as partners, will also need users to give data on which apartment partner they are residing in. Any household work can be passed on via the app &amp;#x26; will be assigned partners that live in the vicinity (therefore may able to onboard more partners) and are rated very well. The visits for pest control, Gas checks, other maintenance activities are auto scheduled for the apartment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Measures:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of apartments signed up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of residents availing service &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non apartment services availed by residents (beauty etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) &lt;strong&gt;Customer care portal — Improvements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a new feature, but some improvements that I think could help move the NPS of users. I have noticed that most responses on Playstore, have a very standard response asking for the contact details of the person. While, I understand this is need to check the internal data I feel, if it was more contextual, it would also help the users feel listened. In this case, two things could be done, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An assurance that the user’s feature suggestion is noted &amp;#x26; will be looked into &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rescheduling her appointment or giving her a coupon for a beauty service could easily help turn this around. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking to better Playstore results, I have seen the smallest things can move the rating towards positive outcome. Additionally it would also help to have quicker response to customer queries, so it doesnt’ reach Playstore as often, by maybe using services like — &lt;a href=&quot;https://verloop.io/&quot;&gt;Verloop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ocSA9nExTVLyB2MBZW8IMg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) &lt;strong&gt;Partner app — Check in process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6JqVS4Eu5ou-0c5Fdoqp6w.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be an ops process problem, since most people address problems around not being verified, not getting enough leads or poor customer support. While there are obvious things that I, as an outsider cannot understand about this internal system, I have some suggestions that may help here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assigning a chat bot &amp;#x26; addressing queries on the app in itself, especially frequent concerns raised by the partners. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some handholding on how to convert more leads or how to present their profiles better to get picked for their respective services. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding meetups &amp;#x26; having high earning partners to share their ways, it will increase trust, build community &amp;#x26; more over allow partners to share vital concerns offline &amp;#x26; not online as much, where we could lose the potential partner signups’ trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think UC should do next? I’d love to know what you think! :) Reach me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vindytalks&quot;&gt;twitter!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Product or Features Should You Develop Next?]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have been reading a lot about feature prioritization and attracting newer audiences, and I want to put what I have been learning into practice, which is what motivated this post.]]></description><link>https://www.vindhyac.com/posts/what-features-to-develop-next/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.vindhyac.com/posts/what-features-to-develop-next/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 23:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have been reading a lot about feature prioritization and attracting newer audiences, and I want to put what I have been learning into practice, which is what motivated this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have never heard of Dunzo, here is what it does:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a delivery service app, meaning anything (legal) you need delivered to you, right where you need it. Dunzo made waves because of how good it is, but also for being Google’s first direct investment in a startup in India. It’s also backed by Blume ventures and Rajan Anandan, among other big names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what it does on a surface level, let’s jump into what I think, as a company, Dunzo could do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*PoCslbKuO3QzlJfJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into what, I think it’s also important to look at who. Currently Dunzo’s customer base is 18–30 year olds. While there is a lot of potential to serve to this target group, I’m going to suggest a slightly older market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50–60 year olds that are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open to new technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use WhatsApp frequently and Google things in full sentences i.e. — “How to do this task on my phone?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find it a little difficult to get things done, beyond the realm of the neighborhood stores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can book cabs but are slightly confused why map location is always showing the backyard of the house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And their most important need: The ability to call someone slightly younger to “Dunzo” something for them or get a task done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY THEM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brand loyal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agnostic to external environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underserved, but easy to retain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you look at this target group with the AARM framework, while Acquisition and Activation are difficult, Referral and Monetization (the two solid pillars for a product like Dunzo) are easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT, NEXT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of features or directions I feel they could pursue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription Medicines:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PPvWMfHkGDRzhy5hvH1Rnw.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, on the apps, you can buy certain medication without adding a prescription, but most need prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if instead of the prescription being added via gallery, you asked to schedule a call with a physician? Depending on how the feature is performing, you could increase the doctors, you could start with popular areas, and then extend services. Do a one-up if the medicine needs refill, allow an option to automatically have it delivered at that time, or place a call for the customer with the same doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**2. Build a web app: **
A lot of apps have gone this route and succeed to get market share they thought they didn’t even have. Here is how &lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/web-booking-flow/&quot;&gt;Uber &lt;/a&gt;did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your key metric is number of orders and revenue, why play only on mobile? Especially for these customers, that probably are new to the experience of Dunzo and don’t want to commit to giving you an app share on their device. Why fight something that doesn’t contribute to the core of who you are? While I suspect you may have this in pipeline, I hope it sees the light of day soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Ride with ‘em:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*3FSUXaV8CHI8itHP.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this post sat in my drafts, Dunzo has already launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://beebom.com/dunzo-bike-rides-noida/&quot;&gt;“bike ride” feature&lt;/a&gt;. However, this seems great for testing the feature out, but I think what will truly disrupt it is if on the rider’s side, every Dunzo partner was made available but their destination was to where they had to make a delivery and you could ride with them, if the place was close to where you needed to be. Think &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickride.in/&quot;&gt;Quikride&lt;/a&gt; but with Dunzo partners and higher revenue (because two birds with one stone?!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;strong&gt;. Geni(ous) Feature:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*_s-VWVzQATf0PP-J.png&quot; alt=&quot;Genie by [Mayank Khandelwal](https://dribbble.com/mayankk98)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genie by &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/mayankk98&quot;&gt;Mayank Khandelwal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this like a search bar feature, where the users simply give the task and trained, street smart Dunzo heroes figure out the solution for it. For example, a query could be: “Laptop not working, screen gone. Pls fix it for me.” There is no added information or store mentioned, when the Dunzo person receives this order, he accepts the task, figures out how to get it done and is compensated with some formulae involving his time, competency, distance to deliver the task. This will change Dunzo from just a delivery app to an everything app for this customer base. This Dunzo meets Just Dial meets Google Search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FUN FACT : Before Dunzo became an app, I think they offered delivery via WhatsApp, at the same time, there was another Whatsapp group doing the same thing, I had met the founder to tell him how I thought it could capitalize on the market, he didn’t follow through and soon shut shop. Perseverance my friend, gets it DUN ;)!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think this makes sense or doesn’t, I’d love to know! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vindytalks&quot;&gt;Let’s chat&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[15 Take Aways From Being a Product Manager at a High Growth Startup]]></title><description><![CDATA[This month, exactly a a year ago, Loco happened to me, or we happened to each other.

Here are fifteen things I took away that I thought would be useful to other product managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Don’t wait on an answer — move forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this is a high growth, “make or break” situation you have encountered. Sometimes you have to believe in your answer, your work and move on. If you have worked in bigger organizations like I did, you would be a little hesitant to take this step, but don’t let that deter you. Commit &amp;#x26; move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Solve a problem and ship it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest way to work your way around this fast paced industry is to ship something quick. Don’t stand around and make assumptions and read vanity metrics. Pick a problem, solve it, ship it. This helps you gain trust among your developers, credibility with the management &amp;#x26; most importantly you realize your own shortcomings or strengths. This doesn’t mean you have to go out of the way, to research &amp;#x26; put a feature together, pickup a bug fix if you have to, but the take away is to ship it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Keep everyone in the loop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let people know what is happening within your product. Present numbers, tell them what the numbers are telling you. Why we are building version two of something or why we are not? Why we must fix that annoying bug and why we are tightening deadlines? Explain it all. When I started, I explained &lt;em&gt;everything I do in a day&lt;/em&gt; to the rest of the team. Considering I was the first one to join the team, I did a lot and not everyone understood all of it. I also made sure, everyone that needed access to data, got it and then I made sure they learnt how to get it themselves. It took hours of my time to explain the same concepts to a different audience every time, but it also made sure everyone knew the what and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Learn from everyone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one has specific skill-sets, and it is always good to learn from them. I make it a point to snoop around, sit with each function enough to know what they &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; do. You don’t have to get it all, but it is good to know some of it and understand the delays and decisions that get made in each function. Since so much of a PM’s job is to facilitate and get the job done, it also helps in knowing what the jobs are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Stay on top of trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This took some getting used to but its very necessary to know what is out there. Given that I work in consumer apps and a really competitive niche in that (games &amp;#x26; live-streaming) it was rather important to know what is happening where. The problem wasn’t knowing where to find this information, it was staying on top of it. Being comfortable trying a lot of apps, making notes (can’t tell you how many unread vague docs I have made on things I was inspired by).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*QtIR0_8mv0Sdnj-9ZNv7-A.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Image by [Gerd Altmann](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;#x26;utm_medium=referral&amp;#x26;utm_campaign=image&amp;#x26;utm_content=2167840) from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;#x26;utm_medium=referral&amp;#x26;utm_campaign=image&amp;#x26;utm_content=2167840)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;#x26;utm_medium=referral&amp;#x26;utm_campaign=image&amp;#x26;utm_content=2167840&quot;&gt;Gerd Altmann&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;#x26;utm_medium=referral&amp;#x26;utm_campaign=image&amp;#x26;utm_content=2167840&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Look beyond the day to day numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems so obvious, but you really forget in the day to day activities. Everyone, the CEO, the VPs are all looking at the DAU, WAU, MAU, overall retention and all those important numbers,** **the problem is, these numbers are not where the answers lie, they matter-of-factually tell you how your product is doing. The magic lies in funnels, segments, cohorts that not everyone is looking at. Go down these rabbit holes, from time to time. You have no idea what you will discover. This is your area of expertise, if you are simply telling/ giving people information they already know, you are not doing your job well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Be customer support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress this enough. I have been customer support over weekends, I have jumped on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vindytalks&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; the minute someone has had an issue, and have had DM conversations with them. It is for this very reason, I know my users so well. I know most of our followers, the cheerleaders and the naggers on first name basis. This helps me to think what to build next, why something makes sense to this group of users, what communication will engage them, what copy-writing will get them to engage more. These insights helped me a great deal while working on our Playstore listing, increasing our notifications CTR. There is so much your users want to tell you, if you just listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Experiment. Learn. Repeat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, let’s A/B test that one!” A common phrase you will hear in almost all meetings. This is very dangerous, you have to commit to your decisions, remember that most of your decisions are reversible. Research, adapt, build and learn. There is no other way to do this. Some feature you launch will see no traction, other feature you have no hope for will click. So really just experiment. Know your goals, align your thinking but don’t stop pondering over how to solve or better your product. It is dangerous to be stagnant than it is to be incrementally experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Have a launch playbook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first 30 days, figure out everything that needs to be done, when you put a feature together. Then make notes and keep that checklist handy. Keep marketing, communications, content, design all the teams in check. I remember not being big on checklists and just winging it, but I cant tell you how humbling it has been to know I am wrong. I then created a PM process document that I go back and look at very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Pick up the slack for your team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s trying to meet deadlines so get your product in the best shape possible. Remember you’re the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.productfocus.com/product-manager-janitor/&quot;&gt;janitor&lt;/a&gt;, so pick up whatever is pending, see if you can help and then HELP. If there is a bottleneck, solve it. If your developers need something, fight for it, hold meetings or don’t hold meetings do whatever is necessary. More often than not, people don’t do this. They assume the issue will sort itself out or will very generically leave a work email or message instead of doing the work themselves. Well guess what? That is exactly the PM no one wants to work with. Please, do not be this person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Mind the line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to remember no matter what role you made this transition from, you have left that job behind you. If you were a developer, designer, founder it not longer applies to you. You are a facilitator, your job is to make sure nothing is stuck. So if that means you’re fixing spacing, giving design briefs, writing copy, do it, but also remember people at that job are far better than you are, so always keep in mind that you might not know the complexities of every function. So help where you can, but also mind your line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. It’s okay to say “I don’t know.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was really difficult for me to do. Initially, to say “I don’t know” in a meeting felt like I hadn’t done my part well enough, that I didn’t cover all the groundwork. As these meetings went on, I realized more people around me also said “I don’t know” but they always went and found out the missing piece of the puzzle, that is what truly mattered anyway. Always remember, you don’t have to be right, you just have to build right. No matter where or who that knowledge comes from, that is totally okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Be the last one to leave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning I always ended up leaving work at 2am and being in early. This helped me keep the team’s progress in check. They knew someone was not just handing them a product requirements document, sending a slack message and being hands off until someone else got the work done. They knew, I would do everything it takes to ship the product. I was always available for clarifications, I would accommodate all the questions, repeat my reasons a 100 times if I had to, and never let the team work without me. No matter what the time, 8am meetings or 2am bug bashes. I was there, all-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Know thy people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like your users always know who you are working with. A good PM is also a people person. Know how to handle everyone that you work with. They all come with different temperaments and you need to win over every one of them. This is not easy, it doesn’t happen on Day 1, but you have to win their trust, make them your ally and really be their confidant. I don’t think you can fake this, you really have to spend time with people to get to know them, but once you build that bond, the things you build will always be in rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Question things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always have a lot of questions to ask, but I didn’t always ask them out loud. I always assumed that if there was something I needed to know, I will be told. Everything else was probably classified. I can’t tell you how wrong I have been about this. You’re moving as fast you can, capturing markets, understanding trends, looking into your roadmaps, building relationships along the way. It is always, always important to know the whys and whats. Allow yourself the opportunity to be curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re starting your career in product, or simply want to talk all things product, know that I would love to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vindytalks&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; and help :)

Given this hustle culture in the startup world, you’re constantly running to solve the next problem! This is not reserved to our team alone. This is from teams across our industry and team members are not taking sufficient time to pause and reflect. The combination of this round-the-clock-work and wanting to constantly ship great products has made meditation, exercise, and vacations the need of the hour. It is no wonder that mindfulness has become a $250 Million market. Given how great Headspace is doing in this market, I decided to understand the app better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who haven’t discovered Headspace yet, it’s a mindfulness and meditation app. It promises to make* “Meditation Simple”.* Although it is a worthy mission to pursue, it is a fairly tough task to achieve. However, Headspace has made a strong dent here. In our own team, every other person has experienced at least one session on Headspace and felt much better after it. We love the mindfulness it helps us achieve. But there is more than meditation it has taught me as a PM! Here are few of those invaluable lessons summarised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The right to way to onboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*TpBM0z7y-V7stk7R5_dNCw.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone that downloads the apps, Headspace tells you right away where it sees you using the app. In a bus while traveling, at office amidst a busy day, at home on your comfy couch or even while vacationing in the mountains. No matter who you are or where you are, you can meditate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their previous onboarding screens, they simply told you “why” you should meditate. I think they soon realized, this wasn’t even the problem. Everyone knew why it was good, they failed to know when they could meditate. Onboarding your users, means different things to different products. Identifying early on what value to give your user on first launch of your app is very important and it’s a funnel point you should often re-vist and engage with as you grow, Headspace seems to have got this on point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Talk to your users, don’t tell them:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*CQ_9GlSVNPm0-gh3ZfQd7g.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language feels safe, fresh and easy. It’s almost like you’re talking to that friend who gives you the advice you need, in a way that it doesn’t offend you. An important lesson here is to know how your users talk and therefore how you should interact with them. You usually recommended meditation apps when you’re under a lot of stress or when you’re feeling down. Headspace seems to understand that user emotion very well and their app copy is on point. A lot of apps have very generic content that even targeted users don’t connect with, because it addresses no one in specific. It is vital to understand where your users are, who they are and talk to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Engage first, sell later :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*VuOGdEMii8ltY0N217-aAQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first open the app, it doesn’t talk to you about the subscription model of Headspace right away. That information is a scroll away. The first time I was on the app, I had no idea that there was even a paid version of it. On the UX front, it focuses on getting you to complete the first ‘Basic’ meditation session. That’s all and nothing more. So, show the user what you have to offer first up — become their habit and then sell. Ask for their time and their money only after you have proven worthy to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Design to make it fun:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*LaT-KbA9aGhlP8TO8MKsyg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, meditation is thought of as a very difficult task to achieve. The general mindset of people is that it is for yogis and monks and not for regular folks. So if you look for “meditation” on the Playstore, you end up with apps where Guruji’s tell you the right way to practice these techniques. For a first timer, this can be quite intimidating. Headspace understands this and therefore creates a fun, engaging, non-generic illustration with toned down colors that create a warm feeling as you enter the Headspace world. The lesson here is — Differentiate on design but also make it relatable to your audience. Every time I see a big-eyed teal amoebic creature on a light purple background, I think of Headspace. The same way, every time a Loco user sees a Hippo they associate it with us. Build a brand that gets recognized outside the app — it’s something that we should continuously strive for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Reward right:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*GTJUjs72RwA7RRBMUXCnVQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this seems quite hard to achieve, probably because meditation is not my habit yet, I think rewarding right is key for any app. I love how the number of streaks start after completing just one day. It gives me a sense of accomplishment the very first time I interact with Headspace. Gamification is used in all kinds of apps, but getting it right is extremely hard. Though I’d love to see some changes in the thought process of Run Streaks (like probably limiting it to day 90 and giving other achievements for check-ins after that), I think it’s a good start! On Loco, we have a concept of streaks, which has seen great numbers for us — but more on that in another blog! My point, keeping the user engaged via little achievements is no easy task, but make sure you reward them more actionable things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Clever push notifications:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*r7Ap5xuzJ89vsAWeabsl5g.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I truly adore are their notifications. As a company that has 6 games everyday, our challenge is to bring people to the app at the right time. Push Notification CTR’s are hard to crack as it is, but Headspace does something different which I am excited to try for Loco! It gives you these *mindful moments *as they call it. It requires no click through, no action. It simply wants you to rethink, focus and practice being mindful. So if I want to be mindful everyday what could I possibly do? MEDITATE! There is the recall they want! It’s brilliant. I also love that Headspace has the large orange circle as their logo so even when you’re on another app/screen, the logo on the notification tray will grab your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Content is key:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While marketing and PR is great, there is nothing like building in-house content to sell your brand value. Headspace seems to have got this bang on! Headspace has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/blog/&quot;&gt;daily blog&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/Getsomeheadspace&quot;&gt;youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; with more than 10M views on most of their videos, a podcast and content by the founder himself (monk turned tech mogul) — &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andypuddicombe&quot;&gt;Andy &lt;/a&gt;Puddicombe. Both inside the app and things related to the app, they actively promote what they promise — &lt;em&gt;Making Meditation Simple.&lt;/em&gt; Even at Loco, we have learnt how important it is to produce quality content and not just game updates! Which is why we make memes, ask riddles, make short story games on Instagram etc — to engage users while creatingt content that is relatable and still Loco-centric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Create scarcity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SlNz1qh1QGtY0BuE1LDcpg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have gone through Headspace enough, I crave for more but now it comes with a paywall. By this time, Headspace has made me understand the value it can give me. To try more, I have to get my wallet out. I am okay with this because I really want to experience what Headspace can offer more. We have understood this very early on at Loco, which is why we don’t have games all the time. We have appointed games where the user has to come in at the right time to play. This scarcity creates a hook for users to keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Make it social&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*quhbMz6Fdw1iKnTrzJRPlA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great way to get users to come back to the app — get them to add their friends to your app! Headspace lets you nudge your friends and keep them informed about your progress. Whenever you use an app you love, you’re sure to call your friends on it. Once your friends are on the app, you’re hesitant to leave it because there is so much attachment to the community you have built. We started this at Loco too, by introducing the Friends leaderboard, so you can keep your community close-knit and competitive. Headspace also tells you how many people are currently meditating, making you feel like there are like-minded folks around you. We do this in our app too by showing users how many live users are currently playing with you. Knowing that you’re not alone, is a great way to make you feel like you’re part of something bigger than yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;More research, fewer assumptions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headspace is not selling you nonsense. It is not assuming a market that’s solving a problem which exists nowhere. It does not build features over tweet suggestions. It builds via research. They have an entire section dedicated to this on their website, to show you what their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/science/meditation-research&quot;&gt;ongoing research&lt;/a&gt; has found and how they are striving to get better. They rely on data to make strong decisions. While this is a difficult task to achieve, Headspace seems to be doing a great job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those were my learnings as a PM from Headspace — an app I enjoy both personally and now professionally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll keep breaking down apps we love and learn a lesson or two from them. In the meantime, if there’s an app that inspires you or an app you would like us to break down and analyse, let us know in the comments and we’ll give it our best shot!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is for the folks that are just starting out and have no idea what any industry jargon means. These are thing I wish someone told me at 22!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my career in a Service based company. Few months before I did, one of my senior walked up to me &amp;#x26; said I should not take this job up &amp;#x26; should really look at products that inspire me. So I said — “Like Facebook?” He said ,”Um, maybe start small?”. He went onto tell me how I would get comfortable &amp;#x26; lazy if I didn’t have something exciting coming my way every week. Two years, 5 kilos heavier(ok maybe that’s exaggerated) I am sad that he was right, I am sadder that he failed to give me a Pros &amp;#x26; Cons list to make a better choice. So to anyone that is given a choice, here are 5 reasons you should consider that switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning is limitless&lt;/strong&gt; : Looks like something out of a philosophic book, but really it is so true. I constantly have 100(relevant!) tabs open &amp;#x26; I forever have something to hold my attention. In Services, usually half the sites are blocked, you need 100 email permissions &amp;#x26; one stubborn IT team to give you access for something even like Medium(of course, this is company to company but I am so grateful I don’t have to see the — You cant access this site message anymore.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networking&lt;/strong&gt; : Your key network outside your educational institute is the people you work with. In my previous org, I knew some amazing folks that dabbled at design, architecture &amp;#x26; built products. However for a decade they were in the same company and to them this is all they could achieve. You will see people that started as an associate and grew to managerial position in 15 years, all right there. When you’re comfortable in your cocoon like that, all you know about is your own growth. The idea of being in the same place, didn’t make me feel safe it made me squirmy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills as opposed to politics&lt;/strong&gt; : This isn’t to say that the Product companies dont have politics however, it cant be only politics.(&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; Kids, there is politics everywhere, you cannot escape it, learn your way around.) I remember walking up to a senior architect and asking really basic I-am-a-fresher-I-know-nothing questions &amp;#x26; getting no response! I thought they did this because they wanted me to learn, but when the code was in production &amp;#x26; no one wanted to fix it, it was clear they weren’t all that senior in skills. Skills play a major role in Product, if you are not learning and doing few different courses every week, you will burn out, being your manager’s pet will not save you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt; : I really like that most companies are open to the voices of every person at office. No matter how silly their suggestions, they are mostly heard! In services there are many hoops you jump for everything you need done, which is why most people just dont do! It is a hassle when you’ve to write to your management 5 times a month for one licence!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pampered &amp;#x26; rewarded&lt;/strong&gt; : It’s a known fact that these companies pay more than services because you’re that precious. If you’re not, you will be asked to move on that fast too. Its a bigger rat race than services is, because you have to prove your worth time and again. You can become obsolete, replaceable any second. That is high risk, therefore you deserve the max benefit. Sounds scary, but as long as you bring value to the table you are always looked after well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to say service industry doesn’t work for anyone. It does to amazing managers that can take a release date &amp;#x26; stand by it. It works for engineers that want to develops skills that will give you the next big jump! It works for people that are great at what they do &amp;#x26; would like to keep doing them. I was none of this, I needed to be the dumbest person in the room so I can learn every second, and I am. It doesn’t feel great everyday, I feel like a cheat that will be caught soon for pretending to be smart, until then I will take it. Someday when I feel like I have learnt enough, I might return to the land of services, although the rate at which technology is going I doubt I will even know 10% of it completely!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
