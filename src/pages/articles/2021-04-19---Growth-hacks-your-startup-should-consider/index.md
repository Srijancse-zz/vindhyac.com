Not my favourite because of my own ethical view of the world, but a here is one - "Faking it".
Showing increased supply ( Like lyft/uber) by paying initial drivers a LOT of money so the users could see how easy it was to book.

The community way - Many people just build a community or hope to build one while not thinking of their product as the core. I think best way to grow via community is making sure your core experience is at the center of it. Like [@beondeck](https://twitter.com/beondeck) [@StackOverflow](https://twitter.com/StackOverflow)

The exclusivity hack.I think [@Superhuman](https://twitter.com/Superhuman) [@joinClubhouse](https://twitter.com/joinClubhouse) executed this very well.But do you remember this niche social networking site Ello,that got this wrong? While it was exclusive, it was not brag-worthy. Remember not EVERY product can be exclusive,it has to feel premium!

I dont like this one a lot either - but works. The "be like your competition hack" Advertise like them, or on top of their SEO. I dont want to link here, but any Google search ads can show you this.

You need to be a more established company, but a neat trick is integration hack. Which is ideally giving developers/partners an easier way to do something via you for no added cost. Social logins is a great example of this.


Building in public hack - Tell everyone what is up, buy into your story & they will follow and watch along, simply because they dont see it as often.
[@LambdaSchool](https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool) [@Baremetrics](https://twitter.com/Baremetrics) [@buffer](https://twitter.com/buffer) Do/did this so well, that they are always top of everyones mind.

Referral hack - Ah requires a whole other post. But primarily, dont give money out for referral, if you are a product that can offer/extend your services as an added incentive to get folks to refer, do that.


NPS hack - Unless users rate you 4/5 or above, dont take them to the playstore/app store rating section. Internalise that feedback and work on it. So your rating doesnt drop a lot.


Not hacky but still useful:
Use more photos from your target segment, not random ones on your web/app. Make them warm!
Have fewer steps, lesser words - ALWAYS
Build "charms" that users want -could be stickers, socks, tshirts, instagram filters. Wtv will get you more visibility

 What other hacks, growth things have you seen or worked on that were super fun?
